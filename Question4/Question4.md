# Open-Ended Experiment 2: Geospatial Storytelling with Plotly or Tableau

## Title:
**Visualizing the World: Geospatial Insights from a Global Dataset**

## Objective:
Students will build a geospatial dashboard or visual story using Plotly or Tableau to illustrate a global trend, comparison, or issue.

## Task:
- Select a dataset with geospatial information (e.g., global population, COVID-19 cases, renewable energy usage, etc.).
- Design at least two different types of map visualizations (e.g., choropleth + bubble map).
- Integrate filters or sliders to make it interactive (e.g., year, region).
- Provide a visual story or dashboard that narrates the insight.

## Expected Outcome:
An interactive report or dashboard published/shared via Tableau Public or a Plotly HTML file.

## Skills Developed:
- Geospatial thinking
- Dashboard design
- Interactive UI development
- Data storytelling
